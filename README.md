# Godot Shader Collection

Sometimes you just don't have time to write your own shaders, but also don't want to be just a copy paster?
That's why i made this, a collection of alot of Godot Shaders, Heavy Documented, with sample scenes.

I want to thank a few resources that helped me accomplish this.
